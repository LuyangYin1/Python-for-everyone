# Financial Analysis with Python: Stocks & ETFs

## Project Overview

This project focuses on using Python to analyze and visualize the performance of stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). We will leverage popular Python libraries like `yfinance`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and potentially others to gather financial data, perform calculations, and create informative charts for comparison.

## Project Goals

*   **Data Acquisition:**  Successfully retrieve historical stock and ETF data from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`).
*   **Data Processing:** Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis using `pandas`.
*   **Financial Calculations:** Implement key financial metrics such as:
    *   Daily/Monthly/Annual Returns
    *   Moving Averages (Simple Moving Average - SMA, Exponential Moving Average - EMA)
    *   Volatility (Standard Deviation of Returns)
    *   Sharpe Ratio (Risk-Adjusted Return)
    *   Correlation Analysis (between different assets)
*   **Data Visualization:**  Create compelling and informative charts using `matplotlib` (and potentially `seaborn` or `plotly`) to:
    *   Visualize price trends over time.
    *   Compare the performance of different stocks/ETFs.
    *   Illustrate moving averages and other technical indicators.
    *   Show the distribution of returns (histograms).
    *   Display correlations using heatmaps or scatter plots.
*   **Analysis and Interpretation:**  Draw meaningful conclusions from the data and visualizations.  Explain the observed trends, correlations, and relative performance of the chosen assets.
*   **Code Quality:** Write well-documented, modular, and reusable Python code.  Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python (version >= 3.7):** The core programming language.
*   **yfinance:**  For downloading financial data from Yahoo Finance.  `pip install yfinance`
*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis. `pip install pandas`
*   **NumPy:** For numerical computations. `pip install numpy`
*   **matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. `pip install matplotlib`
*   **seaborn (Optional):**  For enhanced statistical data visualization (built on top of matplotlib). `pip install seaborn`
*   **plotly (Optional):** For creating interactive charts and dashboards. `pip install plotly`
*   **Jupyter Notebook (Recommended):** For interactive development and presentation of results. `pip install notebook`
*   **Git:** For version control and collaboration.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your_repository_url]
    cd [your_repository_name]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Create the `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the necessary packages.)

## Usage

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Run the `data_acquisition.ipynb` notebook to download and prepare the stock/ETF data.  Modify the notebook to specify the tickers and date ranges you want to analyze.  Save the data to the `data/` directory.

2.  **Financial Analysis:**  Use the `analysis.ipynb` notebook to perform financial calculations (returns, moving averages, volatility, Sharpe ratio, correlation).  You can import functions from the `scripts/metrics.py` file if you create one.

3.  **Data Visualization:**  Create charts and visualizations in the `visualization.ipynb` notebook.  Experiment with different chart types and libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) to effectively communicate your findings.

4.  **Analysis and Interpretation:**  Document your findings and interpretations in the notebooks.  Explain the trends, correlations, and relative performance of the assets you analyzed.

## Data Sources

*   **Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`):**  The primary source for historical stock and ETF data.

## Example Analysis Ideas

*   Compare the performance of a growth stock (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) to a value stock (e.g., JNJ, BRK.B).
*   Analyze the correlation between different sectors of the market (e.g., technology, healthcare, energy).
*   Evaluate the risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio) of different ETFs (e.g., SPY, QQQ, IWM).
*   Investigate the impact of major market events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) on stock prices.
*   Backtest a simple trading strategy based on moving averages.

## Contribution Guidelines

*   Use Git for version control.  Create branches for new features or bug fixes.
*   Write clear and concise commit messages.
*   Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
*   Document your code with comments and docstrings.
*   Submit pull requests for code review.
*   Communicate effectively with your team members.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement more sophisticated financial models (e.g., CAPM, Black-Scholes).
*   Develop interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.
*   Create a web application to allow users to analyze their own portfolios.
*   Incorporate machine learning techniques for predicting stock prices.
